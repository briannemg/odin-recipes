        <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Filling:</h5>

    </ul>
    <h5>Garnish (Optional):</h5>

        <li>1 cup packed sweetened flaked coconut</li>
        <li>¼ cup pineapple tidbits, drained</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter three 9-inch round cake pans and dust lightly with flour.</li>
        <li>Prepare cake: Stir flour, sugar, salt, and baking soda together in a large bowl. Stir in eggs and melted butter until just combined. Add sour cream, vanilla and coconut extracts, undrained pineapple and coconut; stir until combined. Divide batter evenly into the three prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until a wooden pick inserted in the middle of a layer comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans on wire racks about 10 minutes. Turn layers out onto the racks and cool completely, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Prepare the buttercream frosting: Beat butter in the bowl of an electric mixer until fluffy and lighter in color. Add 1 cup powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon cream; beat on medium speed for about 1 minute. When the sugar is fully incorporated, add vanilla, salt, 1 additional cup of powdered sugar, and 1 more tablespoon cream; beat for about 2 minutes. Beat in the remaining powdered sugar. If the frosting is too stiff, add a few drops of cream and stir again. Repeat until the desired consistency is reached.
        <li>Prepare the filling: Remove 1 cup of the frosting and place in a medium mixing bowl. Add drained, crushed pineapple and stir. Add a few drops of reserved pineapple juice if the mixture is too stiff.</li>
        <li>To assemble: place one cake layer on a cake plate or stand. Spread 1/2 of the filling on top of the first layer. Put the second layer in place and spread the remaining filling on it. Place the third layer on the top and spread the remaining buttercream frosting on the top and sides of the cake. Garnish the top of the cake with flaked coconut, and add drained pineapple tidbits as desired.</li>
    </ol>
